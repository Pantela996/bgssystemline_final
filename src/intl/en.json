Regardless of the exact percentage, we completely agree that lighting design plays a critical role in our lives – and our projects.Subconsciously, lighting is a major reason why people favor one shop over another, feel more comfortable in one hotel room and not in another, or are more productive in one office over another. The impact of lighting on our daily rest, work, and play is very powerful as it can change our mood, as well as energize and relax us.To ensure the final success of a project, we involve our lighting designers from the onset of each of our projects. By incorporating the input of our specialized team right from the start, we can better integrate the lighting design with the architecture as well as avoid any potential costly changes to mechanical or electrical works at a later stage."
